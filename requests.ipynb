    "Step-by-Step Process:\n",
    "1. First, reason through the general importance hierarchy among the four main criteria categories (resource potential, topographical suitability, environmental constraints, infrastructure connectivity)\n",
    "2. For each pairwise comparison, explicitly articulate:\n",
    "   - The function/purpose of each criterion in solar plant siting\n",
    "   - Their relative contribution to technical feasibility\n",
    "   - Their relative contribution to economic viability\n",
    "   - Their relative contribution to environmental sustainability\n",
    "   - Their relative contribution to social acceptability\n",
    "   - The final judgment value based on this multifaceted analysis\n",
    "3. After completing the pairwise comparison matrix, calculate the priority weights using the eigenvector method\n",
    "4. Verify the consistency of your judgments by calculating the Consistency Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Reasoning (for illustration):\n",
    "\"When comparing Solar Radiation to Land Use, I consider that solar radiation directly determines energy production potential, the primary function of the facility, while land use represents a constraint rather than a production factor. Solar radiation has a fundamental impact on economic viability through energy yield, whereas appropriate land can be acquired through various means. Therefore, I judge Solar Radiation to be strongly more important than Land Use (value: 5).\"\n",
